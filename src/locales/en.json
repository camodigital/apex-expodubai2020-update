    "titlequestion1": "What is the country concept that Brazil intends to transmit?",
    "contentquestion1": "<p>The Brazilian pavilion is at the Sustainability district of Expo 2020. The idea is to lead the visitor through a sensory experience that shows Brazil open to the world, full of opportunities, modern, productive, environmentally conscious and sustainable.</p>",
    "titlequestion2": "What are the concrete expectations of participation results?",
    "contentquestion2": "<p>The Universal Exhibitions are events aimed at the general public, largely formed by families and visitors in moments of leisure. They are, therefore, events in which practically all countries participate in search of image gains, resulting from the experience offered to visitors.</p><p>According to the Expo Organization planning, most of the visitors will be nationals of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as well as Chinese and Indian tourists. Those are extremely relevant markets for Brazilian products. The intention is to help the pavilion visitors to develop a permanent connection with Brazil, so when they come into contact with a Brazilian product or service, the result is a positive association.</p>",
    "titlequestion3": "The Emirates and more specifically Dubai have been trying to become logistics and tourist hub. Is there an opportunity for Brazil in this? Which one?",
    "contentquestion3": "<p>The UAE, in addition to being an extremely important market for Brazilian products (highlighting, among others, our exports of animal protein and in the transport sector), is also an important source of foreign investment (with investment, for example, from an Emirati company in the port of Santos). Exporting to the UAE market also serves as a \"seal of quality\" for the other markets in the region, which is strategic for our companies.</p>",
    "titlequestion4": "Is only Apex-Brasil involved with the project or are there also other companies or government agencies?",
    "contentquestion4": "<p>Apex-Brasil has the responsibility of leading the Brazilian participation in the Universal Exhibition and was formally designated by the Federal Government to do so, having also signed the participation contract with the Organizing Committee.</p><p>A Management Group of the Brazilian Participation in the Expo has been established since 2018 and is currently comprised of several governmental bodies and ministries. Apex-Brasil regularly reports to that group and consults on the most diverse topics. To date, eight meetings of the management group have been held.</p>",
    "titlequestion5": "What is the origin of Apex-Brasil's budget used to build the Brazilian pavilion?",
    "contentquestion5": "<p>The resources for the construction of the Brazil Pavilion at Expo Dubai 2020 are entirely from Apex-Brasil. The Agency is an Autonomous Social Service and is part of the so-called \"S System\", not part of the Direct or Indirect Public Administration. It is a private and non-profit entity, which acts in close cooperation with the public power to implement policies to promote exports and attract foreign investments. To this end, it maintains a management contract with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MRE).  </p>"
